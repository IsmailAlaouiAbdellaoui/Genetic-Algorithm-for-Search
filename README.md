# Genetic Algorithm for Search

## To be or not to be ?
This is the sentence Daniel Shiffman used in his youtube channel to test whether his genetic algorithm was working or not.

You can also play with this search algorithm with the sentence of your choice.

This algorithm can still be improved because it seems that once the target string reaches a specific length, the algorithm can't find it.

To run this code :

* Download the folder
* Open the .sln file in Visual Studio
* Press Ctrl+F5 to run the program
* Enter the sentence you want, and press enter
* Enjoy the magic of Genetic Algorithms !
